# pyTTK
Python implementation of transductive top k algorithm proposed by Liu, et al (2015) in [arXiv:1510.05976](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05976).

## The Model
The model is a modification of a support vector machine restricted to predict at most k examples of a known test set as positive examples (making it a transductive method).
